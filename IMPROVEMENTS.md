## Changelog

### 2026-01-08
- **Phase 1 Complete!**
- Completed 1.1: Added `send_message()` method to TelegramNotifier
  - Root cause: Method was never implemented but called from 18 places
  - Fix: Added public `send_message()` that delegates to `_send_message()`
- Completed 1.2: Fixed Realized PnL calculation
  - Added PnL calculation in `on_order_update()` when SELL (TP) fills
  - Formula: `pnl = (sell_price - entry_price) × position_quantity`
  - Updated `_log_and_notify_fill()` to include PnL in trade record and Telegram
  - State `realized_pnl` now accumulates correctly
- Completed 1.3: Fixed Position size tracking in GridLevel
  - Added `GridLevelState` enum: EMPTY, BUY_PLACED, POSITION_HELD, TP_PLACED, SELL_PLACED
  - Added fields: `entry_price`, `position_quantity`, `tp_order_id`
  - Added `reset()` method to GridLevel for clean state transitions
  - Added `get_level_by_tp_order_id()`, `get_total_position_quantity()`, `get_levels_with_position()` to GridState
  - Updated `place_grid_orders()`, `cancel_all_orders()`, `_place_smart_tp()`, `_re_place_buy()` to manage states
- Completed 2.1: Implemented Grid Level State Machine (bonus from 1.3)
- **Phase 2 Complete!**
- Completed 2.2: Proper Partial Fill handling
  - Added `add_partial_fill()` method for weighted average entry price
  - Track multiple partial fills with `partial_fill_count`
  - Store partial TP order IDs in `partial_tp_order_ids` list
  - Use Smart TP for partial fill TPs
- Completed 2.3: Slippage tracking
  - Added `intended_price`, `actual_fill_price`, `slippage_percent` to GridLevel
  - `calculate_slippage()` method computes slippage on fill
  - Slippage logged and shown in Telegram notifications (if > 0.01%)

## Dependencies

```
1.2 (Realized PnL) ──► 4.1 (Win rate)

2.1 (State Machine) ──► 2.2 (Partial fills)
```

## Notes

### Technical Debt
- Some functions are too long (e.g., `grid_bot.initialize()` ~150 lines)
- Direct config mutation (`config.grid.GRID_SIDE = ...`) should use setter
- Need more unit tests (currently only trend_scoring tests)

### Performance Considerations
- SQLite is sufficient for current scale
- Consider PostgreSQL if running multiple symbols
- WebSocket reconnection could be more robust

### Future Ideas (Not Prioritized)
- Web dashboard for monitoring
- Discord notifications option
- Mobile app for remote control
- API fallback endpoints
